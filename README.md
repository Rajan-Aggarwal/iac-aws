# IAC-AWS

Stands for Infrastructure as Code, for AWS. 

These are some scripts I often use to work/practice on AWS. Each folder represents an infrastructure.
For example, the ec2 folder creates a simple ec2 instance and that's it. The infra folder makes a more 
complete infrastructure around an instance.  

# Usage

./apply.sh <folder-name-of-the-infra> -varfile "<variables-filepath>"
